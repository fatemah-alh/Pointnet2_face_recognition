# Pointnet2_face_recognition

Using private data set of 3d point clouds of faces, annotated with (face id, expression on face, and Unicode of face). <br />
we trained a neural network (PointNet++) for three main tasks:  <br />
face recognition, expression recognition, and Unicode recognition. <br />
as a results, we obtained an accuracy of 94.3% and loss of 0.22 on the face recognition, <br /> 64% accuracy and loss of 0.40 on expression, and worse results on Unicode 56%accuracy and loss of 0.48. <br />
These different results are due to the variety of the distribution of data on classes in each of the above tasks.  <br />
This project was done for the exam "Computer graphics and 3D" in my master's degree.
